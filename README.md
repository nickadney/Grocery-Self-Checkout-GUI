 This is an academic project created for an Object Oriented Programming class. 
 
 It aims to mimic a self check out machine in a grocery store. The back-end contains functionality to hold inventory and keep track of a customer's shopping cart. Some of my favorite functions in this program are the ability to add a discount and the suggestion of similar items that a customer has in their cart. 
 
The front-end was built using the help of Window Builder inside of the IDE (Eclipse) used for this project. It is very clean and simple. The front-end allows a user to add items to their cart while keeping track of the total and an itemized list of items. It works simultaneously with the back end to modify the stock of items being added.
