# Point-of-Sale
This is a project (currently not finished) that I did in Object Oriented Programming with Java. I started this project with the idea that I would create an application designed for a customer of a grocery store. First was the back end (and my favorite part). It consists of three classes, all in the "PointoffSale Backend" package, a tester class used to test functionality, a single entity class that holds a single product (Product) and a collection class that holds Products (ProductCollection). The front end uses Java's Swing components with functionality from the back end. For the front end project we had to have at least 8 unique components with a JComboBox that was dynamically filled by objects in the collection class.
